> Igbo is the principal native language of the Igbo people, an ethnic group of southeastern Nigeria, and is spoken by approx 45 million people in at least 20 different dialects.

This repo parses the words, word classes, definitions, and more from the Columbia University paper [*Dictionary of Ònìchà Igbo*](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00fwp/igbo/IGBO%20Dictionary.pdf).

## Getting Started

This API is not publicly available. To run the API, you must run it locally on your machine.

Clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/ijemmao/igbo_api.git
```

Inside the project, install the project's dependencies:

```
cd igbo_api/
yarn install
```

To start the dev API server run the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see the API

### Usage

To search for a term, use the following route structure"

```
/api/v1/search/words?keyword=<keyword>
```

The response will be a plain JSON object

For example:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/search/words?keyword=agụū
```

returns:

```
{
    "wordClass": "n.",
    "definition": "hunger; desire; eagerness",
    "examples": [],
    "phrases": {
        "(agụū) -gụ": {
            "definition": "be hungry",
            "examples": []
        },
        "agụū mmīli": {
            "definition": "thirst",
            "examples": []
        },
        "-gụ agụū": {
            "definition": "hunger; desire; long for ( -gụ 2. desire)",
            "examples": []
        }
    }
}
```

## Build a Dictionary

Even though the Igbo dictionary files are already available in this repo, you can still run the script that's responsible for parsing the Columbia paper and creating the `.json` files.

`dictionary.html` is an HTML representation of the Columbia PDF.

To parse `dictionary.html` and build a dictionary, run the following command:

```
yarn build
```

This will produce three different files in the `dictionaries` directory:

[ig-en/ig-en.json](./dictionaries/ig-en/ig-en.json)

[ig-en/ig-en_expanded.json](./dictionaries/ig-en/ig-en_expanded.json)

[ig-en/ig-en_normalized.json](./dictionaries/ig-en/ig-en_normalized.json)

[ig-en/ig-en_normalized_expanded.json](./dictionaries/ig-en/ig-en_normalized_expanded.json)
